<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p><strong>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</strong> It has been adapted from a number of
    different recipes that I have read over the years.</p>

<p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>
    <code><em>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</em><br></code>
    <em>175g of tahini</em><br>
    <mark><em>6 sundried tomatoes</em><br></mark>
    <em>Half a red pepper</em><br>
    <em>A pinch of cayenne pepper</em><br>
    <em>1 clove of garlic</em><br>
    <em>A dash of olive oil</em><br>
</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
    Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely<br>
    Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely<br>
    <small>Add all the ingredients into a food processor<br>
        Process all the ingredients into a paste.<br></small>
    If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus&colon; process it for a short time<br>
    <del>If you want a</del> <ins>smooth hummus</ins>, process it for a longer time<br>
</p>

<p>
For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese.<br>
    Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>
    &quot;Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container.<br>
    You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it.<br>
    If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
</p>

<p>
    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
